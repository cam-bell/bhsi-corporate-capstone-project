# BigQuery Failure Handling Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to handle BigQuery integration failures gracefully, addressing two critical issues:

1. **Silent Failures in Background Processing**
2. **Incomplete Fallback Data**

## 🚨 Problem 1: Silent Failures in Background Processing

### Issues Identified

- Failed BigQuery writes in background threads didn't notify users
- Data appeared saved but wasn't actually in BigQuery
- No visibility into failure rates or queue status
- No retry mechanisms with proper backoff

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Async BigQuery Client (`bigquery_client_async.py`)

**New Features:**

- **Failure Tracking**: Comprehensive failure recording with request IDs, timestamps, and error details
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with configurable max retries
- **Success/Failure Statistics**: Real-time tracking of success and failure rates
- **Queue Monitoring**: Detailed queue status with priority-based processing

**Key Components:**

```python
@dataclass
class BigQueryFailure:
    request_id: str
    table_name: str
    error: str
    timestamp: datetime
    retry_count: int
    data_count: int
    operation: str
```

#### 2. New API Endpoints

**Health Monitoring:**

- `GET /api/v1/bigquery/health` - Comprehensive health status
- `GET /api/v1/bigquery/failures` - Detailed failure information
- `GET /api/v1/bigquery/queue` - Queue status monitoring
- `POST /api/v1/bigquery/flush` - Force queue flush

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "bigquery_health": {
    "status": "degraded",
    "failure_rate_percent": 12.5,
    "queue": {
      "total_pending": 15,
      "high_priority": 3,
      "medium_priority": 8,
      "low_priority": 4
    },
    "failures": {
      "total_failures": 25,
      "recent_failures": [...],
      "success_stats": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Frontend Monitoring Component

**BigQueryStatusMonitor Component:**

- Real-time status updates every 30 seconds
- Visual indicators for healthy/degraded/unhealthy states
- Expandable details showing queue status and recent failures
- Failure rate visualization and success rate tracking

## 🎯 Problem 2: Incomplete Fallback Data

### Issues Identified

- Fallback analytics returned empty/zero data
- Users saw "no data" instead of meaningful information
- No realistic mock data for testing and development
- Poor user experience when BigQuery was unavailable

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Mock Analytics (`mock_analytics.py`)

**Company-Specific Risk Profiles:**

```python
def _get_company_risk_profile(company_name: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # High-risk indicators: "banco", "bank", "financiera", "financial"
    # Medium-risk indicators: "energia", "energy", "telecom", "construccion"
    # Default: low-risk profile
```

**Realistic Data Generation:**

- **Event Counts**: 5-25 events per company with realistic risk distributions
- **Risk Distribution**: Based on company name analysis (banking = high risk, etc.)
- **Latest Events**: 10 most recent events with realistic titles and metadata
- **Assessment Data**: Complete risk assessment with all categories

#### 2. Enhanced Management Summary

**Comprehensive Mock Data:**

- **Key Risks**: Company-specific risk analysis with severity levels
- **Financial Health**: Realistic financial indicators based on risk profile
- **Compliance Status**: Detailed compliance analysis by area
- **Key Findings**: Contextual findings based on company type
- **Recommendations**: Actionable recommendations based on risk level

#### 3. Realistic Trends and Comparisons

**System-Wide Analytics:**

- **Risk Trends**: Realistic company counts and trend patterns
- **Sector Analysis**: Industry-specific risk levels and trends
- **Company Comparisons**: Meaningful comparison metrics with risk scores

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. BigQuery Client Enhancements

- **Fallback Integration**: Automatic fallback to enhanced mock data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with meaningful error messages
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health status monitoring

#### 2. Analytics Service Improvements

- **Cache Integration**: Fallback data cached for performance
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Status Reporting**: Clear indicators when using fallback data

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. BigQueryStatusMonitor Component

```typescript
interface BigQueryHealth {
  status: "healthy" | "degraded" | "unhealthy";
  failure_rate_percent: number;
  queue: QueueStatus;
  failures: FailureStatus;
}
```

#### 2. Analytics Page Integration

- Status monitor displayed at top of analytics page
- Real-time updates without page refresh
- Expandable details for technical users

## 📊 Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Status Levels

- **Healthy**: < 5% failure rate
- **Degraded**: 5-20% failure rate
- **Unhealthy**: > 20% failure rate

### Key Metrics Tracked

- **Failure Rate**: Percentage of failed operations
- **Queue Status**: Pending operations by priority
- **Table Failures**: Failures per table with success rates
- **Recent Failures**: Last 10 failures with details

### Real-time Updates

- **30-second refresh**: Automatic status updates
- **Manual refresh**: User-triggered status checks
- **Visual indicators**: Color-coded status chips
